## Purpose:
To design a interactive JavaScript game application

## How to use:
This game consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to created an interactive game for users to select a fighter and a challenger.  
Selection of fighter and challenger moves those characters to the ring while placing the other characters in a waiting area and the fight
bell rings.  As the user clicks on the fight button a message is displayed showing amount of injury to each player as well as their health
scores are dynamically modified.  If a user defeats the opponents they can select another one until either they are defeated losing the game or they defeat all oppenents and win the game.  Hope you enjoy.
